A tweet joked about a bold "first day on the job" move: squash the entire git history into a single commit labeled "legacy code" and push it straight to `master`.

The twist? The author of this tweet is the Head of Engineering at my company.

Turns out the people making jokes about chaotic engineering practices are sometimes the ones leading the team.
