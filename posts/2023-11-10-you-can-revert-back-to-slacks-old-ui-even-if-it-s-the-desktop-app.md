If you preferred Slack's older interface, you can sometimes revert to the previous design even in the desktop application.

**Possible workarounds:**

1. Use specific workspace URLs that point to older interface versions
2. Check Slack's preferences for "legacy" or "classic" view options
3. Use browser extensions that restore old styling

**Note:** Slack frequently removes support for older interfaces, so these workarounds may only work temporarily. Check Slack's preferences menu or community forums for current methods.
