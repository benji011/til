Google's AI-generated search overviews can be overwhelming or inaccurate. You can bypass them entirely by adding a URL parameter that forces traditional search results.

**To disable AI Overview:**

Add `&udm=14` to your Google search URL:

```
https://www.google.com/search?q=your+search+query&udm=14
```

Or bookmark this URL to use it as your default search:
```
https://www.google.com/search?udm=14
```

**What it does:**

The `udm=14` parameter appears to activate Google's "Web" search mode, which shows only traditional blue link results without AI summaries. It's particularly useful when:

- You want authoritative source links, not AI interpretations
- The AI overview is giving incorrect information
- You prefer to evaluate sources yourself
- You need faster, less cluttered results

**Making it permanent:**

Create a custom search engine in your browser settings with this URL format, or use browser extensions that automatically append the parameter to Google searches.
