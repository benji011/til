Instead of swiping through multiple desktops or using Mission Control's visual selector, you can set up keyboard shortcuts to jump directly to specific desktops (Spaces) on macOS.

**Setup steps:**

1. Open **System Preferences** (or System Settings on newer macOS versions)
2. Navigate to **Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control**
3. Check the box for "Mission Control"
4. Click the caret symbol (▶) to expand the options
5. Enable the shortcuts for desktops you want:
   - "Switch to Desktop 1" (usually Ctrl + 1)
   - "Switch to Desktop 2" (usually Ctrl + 2)
   - And so on...

**Usage:**

Once configured, pressing `Ctrl + [number]` instantly switches to that desktop, making it much faster than:
- Swiping multiple times on the trackpad
- Using three-finger swipe gestures to navigate sequentially
- Opening Mission Control to select visually

This is especially useful when you have a consistent desktop layout (e.g., Desktop 1 for code, Desktop 2 for browser, Desktop 3 for Slack) and want quick context switching.
