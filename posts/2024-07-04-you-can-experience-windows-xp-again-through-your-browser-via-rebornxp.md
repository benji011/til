RebornXP is a browser-based recreation of Windows XP that runs without installing anything.

Visit [rebornxp.js.org](https://rebornxp.js.org/) to access a working Windows XP desktop with:

- The Luna theme and Start menu
- Classic applications like Internet Explorer, Notepad, and Paint
- Working file system browser
- XP sounds and visual effects
- Minesweeper and other XP-era games

**Why use it:**

- Nostalgia for those who grew up with XP
- Show younger developers what historical UI design looked like
- See how desktop interfaces have (or haven't) evolved

Just load the page and you're back in 2001.
