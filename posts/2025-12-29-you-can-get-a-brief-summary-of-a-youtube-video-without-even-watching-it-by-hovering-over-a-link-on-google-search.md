Google now lets you see a summary of a YouTube video without ever having to watch it, which is useful if you're doing research and don't feel like watching through a 20 minute video.

For arguments sake, this example video is less than 3 minutes long, but a summary that takes less than 2 seconds to read vs a video less than 3 minutes is still a better alternative for busy people like me. Not so much for content creators though who rely on actual views.
